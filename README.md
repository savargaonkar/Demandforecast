A simple forecasting project using visitor data for a temple in Maharashtra, India. The project allowed me to eliminate food waste at the temple by forecasting the amount of milk that the temple will recieve.

Data was only recorded for 2 months and detailed interaction effect of other parameters has not been studied.
